# hamburger-menu
html css and jquery used to create hamburger-menu it's code might not be perfect but it works perfect
it basically has simple navigation bar using div element and there is another div which I called floating-menu this div will be our menu
for smaller screens and the simple navigation bar gets display:none when the screen is small enough. And there is simple button that pops
up when the screen is small.
